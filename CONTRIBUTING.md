## Developers

see backend/README.md and frontend/README.md

Feel free to open an issue with review comments and suggestions on implementation.

Database experts: Can the schema be improved for lower loads?

OSM experts: How can incremental imports be handled in a sustainable and safe manner?

## Designers

It would be nice to have a better basemap with an outdoor focus. Check out [Maputnik](https://maputnik.github.io/). Unfortunately [OpenTopomap](https://opentopomap.org) will be put into backup mode.

The gradients and colors on the trail networks can also be improved significantly.

## Users

Browse the discovery and update OSM route data to be consistent. Check for invalid links, weird tags.
