# 🗺️ Itinerary: The Linear Trail Guide

**Stop Looking at Maps. Start Planning Your Next Step.**

## **The Problem: When Navigation Becomes Logistical**

Every long-distance hiker, trail runner, and multi-day trekker knows the feeling: you are tired, your pack is heavy, and the traditional 2D map on your phone offers little comfort. The question is never **"Where am I?"** but always **"How long until the next crucial resource?"**

* *How far until that water source?*  
* *Is there a shop in the next town?*  
* *How many kilometers remain until I can resupply?*

Traditional, topographical maps fail the tired traveler because they prioritize geographic accuracy over **logistical sequence**.

## **The Historical Insight: The Way of the Traveler**

This practical, forward-looking mindset is not new; it is, in fact, the oldest form of mapmaking. **Itinerarius** revives this ancient, functional wisdom for the modern trail.

### **📜 The Roman Way: The Tabula Peutingeriana**

The original map of the Roman road network was not a bird's-eye view. The **Peutinger Table** was a 6.75-meter scroll that *ruthlessly distorted* geography, shrinking the Mediterranean and twisting continents. Why? Because it focused on one thing: **the sequence of towns and the exact distance between them.** It was a data sheet, not a terrain map.

### **🧭 The Pilgrim's Guide: Medieval Strip Maps**

Later, medieval **Strip Maps** (such as those guiding pilgrims from London to Jerusalem) continued this tradition, depicting the journey as a simple, sequential timeline. They marked inns, monasteries, and resupply points—the essential services—in order, exactly as they were encountered.

**These weren't "maps." They were "itineraries"—a list of things to come.**

## **Our Solution: The Digital Itinerarius**

**Itinerarius** discards the visual noise of the 2D map to deliver the essential, linear data you need to manage your day, your energy, and your supplies.

### **Main Use Case: The Dynamic Strip Map**

Our core view transforms your entire trail stage into a scrolling, dynamic profile:

* **The Timeline:** The entire day's hike is presented as a clean, continuous horizontal line, showing the accumulated distance from the start.  
* **The Elevation Profile:** The ground you've covered and the ground ahead are plotted, allowing you to instantly gauge the difficulty of the next section.  
* **The Essential Countdown:** Crucially, your custom **Points of Interest (POIs)**—Water, Shops, Campsites, Hostels, and Major Summits—are plotted directly onto this linear profile.  
  * **No more guesswork:** See your current location against the next waypoint and get a real-time **distance countdown** along the path. Know exactly how much climbing is left before you earn your water stop.
