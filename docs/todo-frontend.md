# TODO items for the front end

see review.md

Discovery:

* add search for places - maputnik has a nice implementation
* add zoom and compass buttons
* general: filter using fulltext trigram on server, pagination
* route sidebar: "Hiking Trails" instead of "routes"
* review and update symbol generation (should it be done in the backend maybe?)
* filter routes by Network/pilgrimage=yes/Length/arbitrary OSM tag (dev mode)/
* add: offer order by distance from current location

Itinerary:

* start and end should always be included
* radius filter should be debounced.
* amenities filter too.
* amenities filter should be progressive and handle small geometries better (reflow)
* better names for amenities, more granular
* icons!

then

* Stage-ifier
* QR code/links for planning
